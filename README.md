# QuickBlox Firebase Auth Server

QuickBlox Firebase Auth Server is designed for secure storage of API keys using dotenv.
This server allows you to create a QuickBlox user session using Firebase Authentication with Phone Numbers.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 and above)
- npm (v8 and above)

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configurations

Set up environment variables:

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
2. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be started on the specified port (or default port 3000 if not provided).

### Create QuickBlox session

To create a QuickBlox user session, submit a `POST` request to the `/session` endpoint with the `access_token` received from Firebase.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3000/session \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"access_token": "<FIREBASE_TOKEN_ID>"
}'
```

## QuickBlox

QuickBlox Firebase Auth Server required integration with QuickBlox to establish a secure access mechanism for the Open AI API and Firebase authorization. By incorporating QuickBlox, a double authentication process is implemented to guarantee that only authorized users can gain access to the API. This involves verifying the registration and authorization of the user attempting to access the API, effectively thwarting any unauthorized third-party interference and safeguarding the API against potential attackers.

To integrate QuickBlox into the QuickBlox Firebase Auth Server, follow these steps:

1. Register and set up your QuickBlox account by following the instructions provided in the QuickBlox [documentation](https://docs.quickblox.com/docs/introduction).

2. Obtain your QuickBlox API URL and ensure that these it is correctly configured in the `.env` file.
